        <h2>Understanding the Box Model</h2>
        <p> Every element in a webpage can be thought of as a box. The box model helps us
            understand how much space an element takes up and how it interacts with other elements.
            The <strong>content</strong> is what you see inside the box â€” text, images, or buttons.
            Around it lies the <strong>padding</strong>, which gives breathing room inside the border.
            The <strong>border</strong> wraps the element and separates it from others, while the
            <strong>margin</strong> creates space outside, keeping each box from bumping into another.
