    <h1>Understanding web development</h1>
    <p id="intro" class="section" title="Intro to web debvelopment">
        Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites or web applications. 
    It involves a combination of coding, design, and problem-solving to create functional and visually appealing web experiences. 
    The development process is typically divided into two main areas:

    <a href="#backend" title="Jump to Backend development section"> BACK-END</a>
    </p>

    <p id="frontend" class="section" titl="frontend development section">
       Front-end development focuses on what users see and interact with directly in their browser. 
    It includes the structure, design, and behavior of a website — all created using technologies like 
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks such as React, Angular, or Vue help developers build 
    dynamic and responsive interfaces efficiently.  
    To understand how the front end connects to the server,

    <p id="backend" class="section" title="backend development">
       Back-end development handles the server, database, and logic behind the scenes. 
    It ensures data flows correctly between the front-end interface and the server. 
    Common back-end languages include Python, Node.js, Java, and PHP, along with databases like MySQL and MongoDB.  
    These elements work together to make sure every user action produces the right response.

    <p id="fullstack" class="section" title="full stack development">
       Full-stack developers work on both the front end and back end, 
    giving them a complete understanding of how web applications function as a whole. 
    They can design user interfaces, connect APIs, manage databases, and deploy applications to servers.  
    Many modern developers prefer becoming full-stack to adapt to different project needs. </p>

    <p id=end class="section">
        Web developers use a variety of tools to improve productivity and performance. 
    Code editors like VS Code, version control tools like Git, and platforms like GitHub help manage projects effectively.  
    Frameworks, libraries, and APIs further speed up the process by providing reusable components.  
    Once you’ve gone through these basics,
