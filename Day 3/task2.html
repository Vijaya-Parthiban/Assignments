            <p>On 27 September 2025, during a political rally by TVK leader Vijay held in Veluswamypuram, Karur district, a stampede caused by massive crowd surges resulted in **41 deaths** and left many injured. </p>

            <p>The rally had been delayed significantly, and the large, restless crowd rushed towards the campaign vehicle when the leader arrived, leading to chaos and collapse in multiple zones. </p>

            <p>Several TVK officials, including party general secretary Bussy Anand and district secretary Mathiyazhagan, have been named in the FIR and have sought anticipatory bail. </p>

            <p>Vijay, in a video message, expressed deep sorrow and asked authorities to restrict actions to him rather than targeting party functionaries. </p>

            <p>The state government released videos alleging breach of police cordons and violation of safety norms by the organizers, increasing the intensity of the blame game surrounding the event. </p>
