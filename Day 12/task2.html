    <h2>Float an Image Beside Text</h2>

    <div class="clearfix">
        <img src="imagee.jpg" alt="Sample Image" class="float-img">

        <p>
            This image is floated to the left, allowing the text to wrap around it.
            Float is often used to align images or small boxes beside paragraphs.
            Without a clearfix, the parent element might collapse and not contain the floated content properly.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>
        This paragraph comes after the floated section and stays below it
        because the clearfix ensures the float doesnâ€™t affect later elements.
    </p>
