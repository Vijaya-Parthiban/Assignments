    <h2>Task 4: CSS Border Styles</h2>

    <div class="box solid">
        <h3>Solid Border Example</h3>
        <p>Solid borders are one of the most common border styles in CSS. They provide a clear, continuous line
      around the element, making the content stand out. For example, cards on websites, buttons, and
      input fields often use solid borders to visually separate content from the background.
      A solid border is simple, professional, and easy to read.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="box dashed">
        <h3>Dashed Border Example</h3>
        <p> Dashed borders consist of short lines with spaces between them. They are often used for
      highlighting editable areas, temporary content, or sections that need special attention.
      For instance, a form that is in draft mode or a section that can be dragged and dropped
      can use dashed borders to indicate it is interactive. This style adds a light, decorative touch
      without being too bold.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box double">
        <h3>Double Border Example</h3>
        <p> Double borders show two parallel lines around an element, creating a decorative and elegant look.
      They are often used for emphasis, such as highlighting important announcements, quotes,
      or special offers. Double borders give a sense of sophistication and are less common
      than solid or dashed borders, making them ideal for sections that need visual distinction.
      Use them sparingly for the best effect.</p>
